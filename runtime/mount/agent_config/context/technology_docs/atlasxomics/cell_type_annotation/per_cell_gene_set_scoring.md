# Gene Set Scoring — Complete Workflow Guide

Gene set scoring is a **fast exploratory approach** for cell type annotation that evaluates how strongly each cell expresses curated marker gene panels. It works without requiring high-quality clustering and is ideal for initial annotation of spatial transcriptomics or ATAC-seq data.

**Key advantages:** Fast (5-10 min), no clustering dependency, interpretable  
**Key requirements:** Score normalization, balanced markers, proper thresholds

## Workflow Summary

0. **Check dataset scale** — Inspect samples, cells, and memory usage
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Large datasets (>2GiB) require sample-by-sample processing
   - **NEVER** process all samples together - causes memory crashes and poor annotations
   - **Required approach for multi-sample data:**
     1. Subset to ONE sample
     2. Complete ENTIRE workflow on subset
     3. Validate results thoroughly
     4. Only then repeat for remaining samples

1. **Select cell types** — Choose 5-10 major types expected in tissue
2. **Curate markers** — Extract 40-50 genes per type from CellGuide  
3. **Filter markers** — Keep discriminatory genes (high fold change)
4. **Balance markers** — Ensure equal counts across cell types
5. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Normalize scores** - z-score or min-max
6. **Assign & visualize cell types** — Label by highest normalized score. 
7. **⚠️ CRITICAL - Validate (ALL 7 REQUIRED)**: Read `technology_docs/atlasxomics/cell_type_annotation/evals.md`
   **DO NOT skip, omit, or summarize ANY metric - missing even one invalidates the workflow**
   - Cell type proportions
   - Cluster purity
   - Spatial coherence
   - Marker enrichment
   - Confidence scores
   - Sample consistency
   - Condition changes

8. **Self-evaluate** — Be honest and objective about results. If results are unsatisfactory, go back and revise your work.

**Presentation**: Generate visuals at EVERY step using `w_table`, `w_plot`, and markdown.

## Step 1: Select Expected Cell Types

Choose **5-10 major cell types** realistic for your tissue and organism. Focus on broad categories rather than fine subtypes.

If a cell type is not found in the CellGuide's per-tissue query, expand the query to "All Tissues". 

---

## Step 2: Curate Marker Panels from CellGuide

Extract **40-50 top-ranked markers** per cell type from the CellGuide database.

**Note**
- CellGuide names may not match the cell type names you’re looking for exactly.
- The database is comprehensive and includes broad categories, subtypes, and synonyms.
- Prioritize biological equivalence over exact string matches when searching for cell types and markers. 

**What if a cell type is not found?**
- Use well-established canonical markers from public literature and include it in the analysis. **Never exclude an expected major cell type.**

**Why 40-50?**
- Expect 20-40% retention after discriminatory filtering
- Ensures ≥5 markers remain per cell type after filtering
- CellGuide ranks by marker strength — top markers are highest quality

**Data source:** `latch:///cellguide_marker_gene_database_per_celltype.json` from Latch Data

Filter to genes present in your dataset (`adata.var_names`)

## Step 3: Filter for Discriminatory Markers

**⛔ STOP**: If the dataset exceeds 2 GiB, you must subset to a single sample before running this step.

Evaluate each marker's ability to distinguish cell types by computing **median fold change** across all cluster pairs.

### Recommended Thresholds by Assay Type

| Assay Type | Threshold | Expected Retention | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **ATAC-seq gene activity** | **1.2×** | 20-40% | Lower dynamic range, sparser signal |
| RNA-seq (scRNA/spatial) | 1.5-2.0× | 30-50% | Higher sensitivity and dynamic range |
| Protein (CITE-seq) | 2.0-3.0× | 40-60% | High specificity required |

**Key insight:** ATAC-seq gene activity scores are inherently sparser than RNA expression. **1.2× threshold** is recommended for ATAC-seq data.

**Method:** For each marker, compute median expression per cluster, then calculate pairwise fold changes. Keep markers where median fold change across all pairs exceeds threshold.

**Quality check:** 
- After filtering, verify **each cell type retains ≥2 markers AND there are ≥3 cell types**. 
- If a major cell type does not have any discriminatory marker, add **known canonical markers** from your general knowledge.

## Step 4: Balance Marker Counts (Target: 5 markers per cell type)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Prevent Scoring Bias

**Problem:** Unequal marker counts create systematic bias. A cell type with 20 markers will outscore one with 5 markers regardless of biological signal.

**Solution:** Equalize marker counts across all cell types.

**Method:**
1. Calculate target count (median or minimum of filtered marker counts)
2. Enforce minimum of 2 markers per cell type
3. Take top 5 markers by fold change for each cell type
4. If a cell type doesn't have discriminatory markers, use **canonical markers from general knowledge**. 

**Result:** All cell types have equal "voting power" during scoring.

---

## Step 5: Compute Raw Gene Set Scores

Calculate **mean expression** across each cell type's marker panel for every cell.

**Formula:** For each cell and cell type, score = mean(expression of all markers for that cell type)

This produces a score matrix: cells × cell types

---

## Step 6: ⚠️ CRITICAL — Normalize Scores

### Why Normalization is Non-Negotiable

**Raw mean scores are NOT comparable across cell types** due to:
- Different baseline expression levels across marker sets
- Varying dynamic ranges of marker expression
- Technical biases in specific gene accessibility

**Without normalization:** Cell types with high baseline marker expression will dominate predictions (typically 80-99% mis-classification to a single type).

### Normalization Methods

**Z-score normalization (RECOMMENDED for ATAC-seq):**
- Centers each cell type at mean=0, std=1
- Formula: `(score - mean) / std` for each cell type
- Makes scores directly comparable across all cell types

**Min-max scaling (alternative):**
- Scales each cell type to 0-1 range
- Formula: `(score - min) / (max - min)`
- Useful when z-scores have outliers

**Rank-based (conservative):**
- Converts scores to percentile ranks
- Most robust but loses magnitude information

**For ATAC-seq data: Always use z-score normalization.**

## Step 7: Assign Cell Types

After normalization:
1. For each cell, identify the cell type with the **highest normalized score**
2. Calculate **prediction confidence** = difference between top and second-highest score
3. Add predictions and confidence to `adata.obs`
4. Visualize predicted cell types.

Higher confidence (>0.3) indicates clear cell type identity. Lower confidence (<0.15) suggests ambiguous or mixed populations.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| 99% cells = one type | Missing normalization | Add z-score normalization (Step 6) |
| Only 2-3 types detected | Threshold too strict | Lower to 1.2× (ATAC) or 1.1× |
| Cluster purity <40% | Gene activity ≠ clustering | Use cluster-based approach |
| Rare types not detected | Insufficient markers | Increase initial markers to 50-60 |
| One type dominates (70-80%) | Marker imbalance | Balance marker counts (Step 4) |
| No spatial coherence | Poor quality predictions | Verify normalization and thresholds |
| Low marker specificity | Markers not discriminatory | Lower threshold or use different markers |
| Low overall confidence | Weak marker signal | Increase markers or try cluster-based |
