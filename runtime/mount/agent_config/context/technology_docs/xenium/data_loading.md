# Step 1 — Data Loading

<goal>

Load `.h5ad` Xenium data, attach spatial imagery, and expose basic structure (cells, genes, embeddings, clusters) to the user.
</goal>

<method>

Use Scanpy to read `.h5ad`, infer spatial coordinates in `adata.obsm`, and render with `w_h5(adata, spatial_dir)`.
For multiple `.h5ad`s, merge them and add a `batch_key`.

**Assumptions**

Each sample has a ready-to-use `.h5ad` with counts, metadata, and spatial coordinates stored in `adata.obsm` under a key that:

- contains the word `"spatial"`, and
- is a numeric array with shape `(n_cells, 2–3)`.

**Guidelines**

- Load the `.h5ad` and render with `w_h5(adata, spatial_dir)`, where `spatial_dir` is the folder containing the `.pmtiles` (usually the same as the `.h5ad` directory).
- Before preprocessing, auto-detect existing results:
  - Treat any `adata.obsm` entry as an embedding if it is a numeric 2D array with shape `(n_cells, k)` where `k` is small (e.g. 2–50).
  - Treat any `adata.obs` column as a cluster label if it is categorical or low-cardinality.
  - If such embeddings or clusters are found, assume they are valid and do **not** recompute yet; ask for confirmation in Step 2 before overwriting.
- If multiple samples are provided:
  - Merge `.h5ad` files into a single `AnnData` and add `adata.obs["batch_key"]` to track sample of origin.
  - Create `adata.obsm["Offset"]` by shifting each sample’s spatial coordinates by a sample-specific offset so they appear side-by-side instead of overlapping.

```python
import scanpy as sc

# Example: load a single H5AD and display
adata = sc.read_h5ad("/path/to/xenium.h5ad")
spatial_dir = "/path/to/spatial_dir"  # directory containing pmtiles
w_h5(adata=adata, spatial_dir=spatial_dir)
````

</method>

<workflows>
</workflows>

<library>
- `scanpy`
- `lplots.widgets.h5` (or equivalent `w_h5`)
</library>

<self_eval_criteria>

- Spatial coordinates are detected and displayed correctly in the viewer.
- For multi-sample inputs, `adata.obs["batch_key"]` is present and valid.
- Pre-existing embeddings and cluster labels, if present, are preserved and not overwritten without confirmation.
