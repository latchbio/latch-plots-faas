## QC

Identify filtering thresholds for "genes per bead", "mitochondrial percentage" and "total UMIs". Start with "genes per bead" and go one at a time.

1/ Make histograms of this metric
2/ Plot spatial coordinates for a reasonable range of metrics so the user can identify effects on morphology 
3/ Expose a widget where the user can modify this value
4/ Tell the user how many beads will be removed after applying this value
