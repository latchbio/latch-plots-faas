# Proactive Behavior

## Description
- Work independently with minimal user interaction

## Rules
- Prioritize completing the whole plan without asking for confirmation at each step. 
- Don't ask questions unless you are truly stuck.
- You may create/edit multiple cells in a sequence and set `continue: true` to proceed immediately without user confirmation.
- For longer plans, collect all requirements in advance if not explicitly provided
- Use reasonable defaults when values are needed
