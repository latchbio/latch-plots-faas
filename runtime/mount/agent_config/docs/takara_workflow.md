## Takara Seeker and Trekker Analysis Workflow

This is the **authoritative step-by-step pipeline** for **Takara Seeker** and **Trekker** experiments.
Always follow steps **in order**. Apply **Seeker-specific preprocessing** when required.

1. **Experiment Setup** — **ALWAYS** ask users to confirm whether their experiment is **Seeker** or **Trekker**, and whether their H5AD contains **one** or **multiple samples**. Spatial coordinates are typically found in **spatial** or **X_spatial**
2. **Data Loading** — load data using **Scanpy**.  Ensure the input is a valid **AnnData (H5AD)** object.
    - **ALWAYS** use ```w_h5``` for displaying anndata
3. **Background Removal** — *Seeker only.*
4. **Quality Control & Filtering** — use **Scanpy** to compute QC metrics.
   - **ALWAYS** make histograms of the QC metrics.
   - **ALWAYS** expose filtering parameters using widgets.
   - **ALWAYS** create radio widget and confirm with the user before applying filters.
   - **ALWAYS** tell the user how many cells will be removed before applying filters.
   - If the user declines, **revert to the original AnnData**.

### **PREPROCESSING**
5. **Normalization** — Provide the option to choose between **log1p** and **total count scaling**. Apply **log1p transformation** by default on the QC-filtered dataset.
6. **Feature Selection** — identify **highly variable genes (HVGs)**.
   - Use sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(..., subset=True) to subset the data to the selected HVGs.
   - Allow the user to specify the number of HVGs to retain (default: 2,000 genes).
   - Always generate diagnostic plots using Scanpy for visualization.
7. **Dimensionality Reduction** —  Check if the anndata has PCA and UMAP, if so do not run these steps and give the user an option to rerun
8. If the user wants to recompute PCA and UMAP, compute **PCA** first, then **UMAP** embeddings.
   Expose parameters for:
   - Number of PCs (**default: 10**)
   - Number of neighbors (**default: 40**)
9. Always visualize both PCA and UMAP with ```w_h5```.
10. **Clustering** — compute neighbors if it doesn't exist, apply **Leiden clustering** (resolution = 0.05) on the neighborhood graph.  **Always** display clusters on the UMAP and spatial embedding using ```w_h5```.

### **SECONDARY ANALYSIS**
11. **Differential Gene Expression (DGE)** - identify **marker genes per cluster** using rank-based DGE tests:
    - Default method: t-test_overestim_var (automatically selected in the widget unless the user specifies another method).
    - Allow the user to choose alternative methods (e.g., wilcoxon, logreg).
    - Report top marker genes for each cluster and Make dot plots with scanpy.
12. **Cell Type Annotation** — assign **biological meaning** to clusters using marker-gene dictionaries or reference datasets.
    Allow users to review or override annotations.

✅ **General Rules**
- **DO NOT** delete cells unless explicitly prompted by the user.
- **DO NOT** create duplicated cells.
- Always use markdown to summarize text output after each analysis step. **DO NOT** use ```print()```.
- Always produce **visual outputs** at every stage. Use ```w_plot()``` and ```w_table()``` to display plots and tables on the UI
- Always use ```w_h5``` for spatial embedding and UMAP. For all other plots, use Plotly instead.
Do not use both w_h5 and Plotly for the same visualization to avoid redundancy.
- Always pass a DataFrame object directly to the source argument of ```w_table```. Do not pass a method call or expression (e.g., df.head(), df.round(3), df.sort_values(...)) directly into ```w_table```.
- Apply sensible defaults
- Add well formatted markdown
- Always maintain a clear distinction between **Seeker** and **Trekker** workflows.
- Prioritize **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **interactivity** throughout the analysis.

Some pointers on steps.

### Experiment Setup

- You must ask users to confirm whether their experiment is Seeker 3x3, Seeker 10x10, or Trekker.
- The user's answer will directly influence the code written for background removal.


### Background Removal

*Goal: Remove off-tissue beads (from Curio Seeker data ONLY) to create an on-tissue mask for downstream analysis.*

Three-step filter (applied sequentially):

1/ UMI threshold: keep beads with log10(UMI) ≥ t.
- Pick t at the local minimum between the two modes in the log10(UMI) histogram.
- Typical range: 1–2; expose as widget min_log10_UMI.

2/ Neighborhood density A: square window m×m μm (default m=40).
- Keep beads with count ≥ p (default p=5).

3/ Neighborhood density B: square window n×n μm (default n=100).
- Keep beads with count ≥ q (default q=10).


UI & Plots to generate:

- Histogram of log10(UMI) with adjustable t and vertical threshold line.
- Histograms of neighborhood counts for steps 2 and 3; guide users to choose p and q at local minima.
- Spatial scatter/overlay showing kept vs removed beads after each step.
- Expose widgets for t, m, n, p, q; default to t=1.6, m=40, p=5, n=100, q=10.


### Launch Trekker Workflow

If user provides FastQ files for the Trekker experiment, launch the Trekker workflow using the `w_workflow` widget.
The workflow requires precise user input because each field maps directly to workflow parameters in the code.
You must **parse user answers**, **normalize them into the required formats**, and then construct the `params` dictionary exactly as shown in the example.

#### FASTQ Files
- Every Trekker sample has **two FASTQ files** (paired-end sequencing).
  - **Read 1** → maps to workflow param `fastq_cb`
  - **Read 2** → maps to workflow param `fastq_tags`

These must be provided by the user and wrapped as `LatchFile(latch://...)`.

#### Required User Inputs
For each sample, you must ALWAYS **provide a form using latch widgets** for the following values. Each one has a clear mapping to a workflow parameter:

- **Sample ID** → `sample_id`
- **Analysis date (YYYY-MM-DD)** → `analysis_date`
  - Must be normalized to string format `"YYYYMMDD"` when inserted into params.
- **Tile ID** → `tile_id`
- **Single-cell platform** → `sc_platform`
  - User may one of the three options "10x Chromium Next GEM 3’v3.1", “10x Chromium GEM-X 3’v4”, or “BD Rhapsody WTA”; each maps to the following Python strings:
    - “10x Chromium Next GEM 3’v3.1” → `"TrekkerU_C"`
    - “10x Chromium GEM-X 3’v4” → `"TrekkerU_CX"`
    - “BD Rhapsody WTA” → `"TrekkerU_R"`
- **Input directory** (directory on Latch Data that stores the output of the single-cell platform used during the Trekker experiment) → `sc_outdir` (`LatchDir`)
- **Output directory** (where to save Trekker workflow results) → `output_dir` (`LatchDir`)
  - If not provided, default to:
    ```python
    LatchDir("latch://38771.account/Trekker_Outputs/Test_Data")
    ```

When you use the w_ldata_picker widget to populate the `output_dir` or `sc_outdir` params, ALWAYS retrieve the LData path string by accessing the widget `.value.path` before passing to LatchFile(...) or LatchDir(...)

Use the code below as a template, that uses w_workflow. The code will generate a “Launch” button. Always make sure you are activating the workflow by ```execution = w.value```, where w is the workflow.

In your summary response, explicitly instruct users to click this button to start the workflow.

#### Example Implementation

```python
from lplots.widgets.workflow import w_workflow
from latch.types import LatchFile, LatchDir

params = {
    "sample_id": "TrekkerU_C_MouseBrain",
    "analysis_date": "20240916",
    "tile_id": "LTTag0053_003",
    "fastq_cb": LatchFile("latch://38771.account/Trekker_Example_Datasets/Test_Data/TrekkerU_C_Mouse_brain_R1_001.fastq.gz"),
    "fastq_tags": LatchFile("latch://38771.account/Trekker_Example_Datasets/Test_Data/TrekkerU_C_Mouse_brain_R2_001.fastq.gz"),
    "sc_outdir": LatchDir("latch://38771.account/Trekker_Example_Datasets/Test_Data/scRNAseq"),
    "sc_platform": "TrekkerU_C",
    "subsample_update": "no",
    "output_dir": LatchDir("latch://38771.account/Trekker_Example_Datasets/Test_Data/")
}

w = w_workflow(
    wf_name="wf.__init__.trekker_pipeline_wf",
    version="0.2.3-4fdda8",
    params=params,
    label="Run Trekker workflow",
)
execution = w.value
```
