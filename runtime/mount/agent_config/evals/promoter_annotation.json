Define promoter regions as \u00b11 kb around the transcription start site (TSS) of genes.\n    3. Identify which peaks overlap promoter regions.\n    4. Return a list or count of promoter-associated peaks.\n    5. Provide at least one example of a peak-gene assignment (e.g. \u201cpeak overlaps promoter of ERBB4\u201d)."
