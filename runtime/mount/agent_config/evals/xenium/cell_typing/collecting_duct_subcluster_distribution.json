  "task": "Using the kidney Xenium dataset with per-cell spatial centroids (x, y), subset the AnnData to cells where adata.obs['CN'] equals 'CN5: Collecting Duct Niche'. Then cluster the cells into 3 subclusters and assign labels using the exact vocabulary: PC, ICA, ICB. Use the following marker genes to guide labeling (higher expression in the indicated subtype vs others):\n\nPC: Aqp2\nICA: Atp6v1b1, Slc4a1\nICB: Slc26a4\n\nThen report the distribution of these CD subtypes as percentages of total CD cells. Percentages should sum to ~100%. Include any missing subtypes with 0%.\n\nVocabulary: PC, ICA, ICB\n\n",
