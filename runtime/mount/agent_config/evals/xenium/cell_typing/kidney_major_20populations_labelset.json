  "task": "You are given a preprocessed injured mouse kidney Xenium dataset (300-gene panel) with per-cell spatial centroids. Identify the present cell populations and then normalize your labels to a standard kidney-injury vocabulary using marker-based merging and common synonyms (do not invent new categories). Examples of normalization only (not exhaustive): merge proximal tubule subtypes (e.g., PTS1/PTS2/PTS3) → PT; merge intercalated subtypes (e.g., ICA/ICB) → IC; glomerular endothelial variants → EC; keep Inj_PT and FR_PT as distinct categories. Return EXACTLY: <EVAL_ANSWER>{\"cell_types_predicted\": [\"TypeA\", \"TypeB\", \"...\"], \"label_mapping\": {\"your_original_label\": \"canonical_label\"}}</EVAL_ANSWER>. \"cell_types_predicted\" must be the UNIQUE SET of your CANONICAL labels after mapping.",
