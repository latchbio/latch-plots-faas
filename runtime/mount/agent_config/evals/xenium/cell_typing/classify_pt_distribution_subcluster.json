  "task": "Using a kidney Xenium dataset that contains only day 2 PT cells with per-cell spatial centroids (x, y), cluster the cells into 5 subclusters and assign labels using the exact vocabulary: PTS1, PTS2, PTS3, Inj_PT, FR_PT. Use the following marker genes to guide labeling (higher expression in the indicated subtype vs others):\n\nPTS1: Slc5a12\nPTS2: Cyp2e1\nPTS3: Slc7a13\nFR_PT: Havcr1\nInj_PT: Vcam1, il34, Cd44\n\nThen report the distribution of these PT subtypes as percentages of total PT cells. Percentages should sum to ~100%. Include any missing subtypes with 0%.\n\nVocabulary: PTS1, PTS2, PTS3, Inj_PT, FR_PT\n\n",
