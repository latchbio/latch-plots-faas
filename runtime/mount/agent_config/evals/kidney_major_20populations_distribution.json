  "task": "Using the kidney Xenium dataset (300-gene panel) with per-cell spatial centroids (x, y), assign each cell to one of the 20 populations in the vocabulary below, then report the overall distribution as the percentage of total cells per type. Use exact vocabulary strings (apply synonym mapping such as FR_PT → FR-PT, Inj_PT → Inj-PT, EC → non-glom EC). The percentages should sum to ~100%.\n\nVocabulary: Pod, Glom-EC, non-glom EC, PTS1, PTS2, PTS3, Inj-PT, FR-PT, DTL, TAL, DCT, CNT, PC, ICA, ICB, Uro, PEC, Fib, Per-SMC, Immune\n\nReturn a JSON object with fields: total_cells (number), cell_type_distribution (object mapping each cell type from the vocabulary to its percentage of total cells).",
