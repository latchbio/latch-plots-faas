Let me first check the notebook context to understand what's already available.\n\nFrom the notebook context, I can see it's empty, so there's no data loaded yet. I need to:\n\n1. First, identify what kind of spatial assay this is (Takara, AtlasXOmics, Visium, etc.)\n2. Load the data\n3. Set up and launch the appropriate clustering workflow\n\nHowever, I don't have enough information yet:\n- What spatial assay platform is this?\n- Where is the data located?\n- Is this Takara Seeker/Trekker or AtlasXOmics (which have specific workflow requirements)?\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n- For AtlasXOmics, I should use `w_workflow(wf_name=\"wf.__init__.opt_workflow\", ...)`\n- For Takara, there's a different workflow\n\nI should first ask the user to clarify what type of spatial data this is and help them load it. But according to the \"Clarifications\" rule, I should ask at most one focused clarification only if execution cannot proceed safely.\n\nSince I need to know:\n1. The spatial assay type\n2. The data location\n\nI should ask these questions to proceed. Let me start by creating a plan and asking for clarification.\n\nActually, re-reading the instructions: \"For anything non-trivial, produce a **plan** first in one turn with `continue: true` to immediately begin execution\". However, I cannot begin execution without knowing the data location and assay type.\n\nLet me propose a plan and ask the minimal questions needed to proceed.",
