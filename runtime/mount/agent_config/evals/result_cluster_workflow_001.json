Modify the \"Clustering Scope\" widget to \"Subset of cells\"\n2. Select the subset type\n3. Re-run the workflow configuration\n\nThe notebook is ready for you to launch the clustering workflow whenever you're ready!"

The conversation history shows that the agent properly loaded the data, created appropriate parameter widgets, configured the workflow with the correct structure (including Genome enum, Run dataclass), and launched the workflow. The agent avoided writing clustering code directly and instead used the workflow system as required. However, the conversation history shows 'UNKNOWN' for most entries, making it difficult to verify all intermediate steps. The final notebook state clearly shows Cell 13 using w_workflow with proper configuration and Cell 15 checking execution status, indicating successful workflow launch. The agent created parameter widgets (data_type, clustering_scope, subset_type) and connected the data appropriately. Minor deduction is due to incomplete visibility of the full workflow parameter configuration and the lack of clarity in some intermediate steps.",
