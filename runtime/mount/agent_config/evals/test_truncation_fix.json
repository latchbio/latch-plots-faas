The string should contain multiple lines describing the purpose of testing. After defining the function, call it and print the result.",

  "judge_prompt": "Evaluate whether the agent correctly completed the task. Check:\n\n1. Markdown Cell: Did the agent create a markdown cell explaining the task?\n2. Code Cell Created: Did the agent create a code cell with a function definition?\n3. Function Name: Is the function named 'generate_long_text'?\n4. Function Content: Does the function return a string that is at least 600 characters?\n5. Function Called: Does the code cell call the function and print the result?\n6. Source Code Complete: Is the FULL source code of the code cell visible and NOT truncated? The source should be complete, not cut off mid-line.\n7. No Errors: Did the task complete without errors?\n\nIMPORTANT: Check if the source code in the code cell is complete. If it appears truncated (e.g., ends mid-line like 'return \"some te'), this is a critical failure.\n\nProvide a structured evaluation with:\n- score: 1.0 if all criteria met, 0.5-0.8 if mostly correct, 0.0 if failed\n- passed: true if score >= 0.8\n- successes: list what was done correctly\n- failures: list any issues, especially if source code is truncated"
