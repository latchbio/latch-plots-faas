Widget Usage: Did the agent use w_workflow widget to launch the clustering algorithm?\n2. Parameters: Did the agent create widgets for the workflow parameters (e.g., number of clusters, algorithm type)?\n3. Data Connection: Did the agent properly connect the latch data node to the workflow?\n4. Execution: Did the workflow get launched successfully?\n\nProvide a structured evaluation with:\n- score: 0.0 to 1.0 (0.0 = complete failure, 1.0 = perfect execution)\n- passed: boolean (true if score >= 0.7)\n- reasoning: detailed explanation of the score\n- successes: list of specific things done correctly\n- failures: list of specific things done incorrectly or missed\n\nNote: The agent should NOT write clustering code directly. It should use the workflow system."
